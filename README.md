# Code_Louisville_FSJS_Capstone

This is my Code Louisville FS Java Script capstone project.  This project is an application to create and store
quotes from the Star Wars franchise.  There is also a button to replace the last Yoda quote with a Darth Vader quote,
and a feature to delete quotes by Darth Vader.  Begin by going to the root directory of the project, and running npm install 
in order to install the neccessary packages. Next, run npm start to begin the start the server process. 
Lastly, open a localhost window to port 3000.
